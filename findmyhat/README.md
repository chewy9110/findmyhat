Title: JFSD web project 03
This is the second development project. This time using javascript.

Description:
 
This project uses javascript to describe a game to find the hat within a field perimeter. There are pothole obstacles (o) in the field perimeter. 
User (*) uses 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R' key to navigate, avoiding the pitholes to find the hat (^).  

Roles: '*' = user, 'o' = hole, '^' = hat
 
Field Demo: 

*░ooo░o░░o
o░o░░░░░oo

oo░o░oooo░
░░░░░░░░░o
░░░░░o░░o░
░░░░░o░░^░
Enter (u, d, l or r)
which way?


●	What did you like about this project?

 I am able to practise my newly acquired skill in javascript to build a console game which works. I also learn how to use node.js and npm packages to help to simplify my coding.
 
●	What did you struggle with in this project?

Defining the javascript class was a challenge because it was not easy to understand how the variables were used when the class was instantiated. It requires more reading in order to understand about javascript class and its proper uses. 

●	What would make your experience with this assessment better?

If more time were given, it would be better for me to define the class in another js file and linked to the main.js file.
